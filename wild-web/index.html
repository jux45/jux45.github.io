                    Viruses are all around us, comprising an enormous proportion of our environment, in both number and total mass. All living things encounter billions of virus particles every day. For example, they enter our lungs in the 6 liters of air each of us inhales every minute; they enter our digestive systems with the food we eat; and they are transferred to our eyes, mouths, and other points of entry from the surfaces we touch and the people with whom we interact. Our bodies are reservoirs for viruses that reside in our respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts. In addition to viruses that can infect us, our intestinal tracts are loaded with myriad plant and insect viruses, as well as hundreds of bacterial species that harbor their own constellations of viruses.

                    More than half a century has passed since Salvador Luria wrote this credo in the introduction to the classic textbook General Virology. Despite an explosion of information in biology since Luria wrote these words, his vision of unity in diversity is as relevant now as it was then. That such unifying principles exist may not be obvious considering the bewildering array of viruses, genes, and proteins recognized in modern virology. Indeed, new viruses are being described regularly, and viral diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis, and inﬂuenza continue to challenge our eﬀorts to control them. Yet Luria’s credo still stands: even as our knowledge continues to increase, it is clear that all viruses follow the same simple strategy to ensure their survival. This insight has been hard-won over many years of observation, research, and debate; the history of virology is rich and instructive

                Viruses Can Cause Human Disease With such constant exposure, it is nothing short of amazing that the vast majority of viruses that infect us have little or no impact on our health or well-being. As described in Volume II, we owe such relative safety to our elaborate immune defense systems, which have evolved to fight microbial infection. When these defenses are compromised, even the most common infection can be lethal. Despite such defenses, some of the most devastating human diseases have been or still are caused by viruses; these diseases include smallpox, yellow fever, poliomyelitis, influenza, measles, and AIDS. Viral infections can lead to life-threatening diseases that impact virtually all organs, including the lungs, liver, central nervous system, and intestines. Viruses are responsible for approximately 20% of the human cancer burden, and viral infections of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts kill millions of children in the developing world each year. As summarized in Volume II, Appendix, there is no question about the biomedical importance of these agents.

                    The field of virology encompasses viral discovery, the study of virus structure and reproduction, and the importance of viruses in biology and disease. While this text focuses primarily on viruses that infect vertebrates, especially humans, it is important to keep in mind that viruses infect all living things including insects, plants, bacteria, and even other viruses. Viruses are not solely pathogenic nuisances; they can be beneficial. Viruses contribute to ecological homeostasis, keep our immune responses activated and alert, and can be used as molecular flashlights to illuminate cellular processes. Viruses have been part of all of human history: they were present long before Homo sapiens evolved, and the majority of human infections were likely acquired from other animals (zoonoses). As viruses continue to be discovered, our understanding of how human health and well-being are affected by these agents remains incomplete. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and depend on their host cell for all aspects of the viral life cycle. While Koch’s postulates were essential for defining many agents of disease, not all pathogenic viruses fulfilled these criteria. Viruses can be cataloged based on their appearance, the hosts they infect, or the nature of their nucleic acid genome. The Baltimore classification allows relationships among various viral genomes and the pathway to mRNA to be determined. A common strategy underlies the propagation of all viruses. This textbook describes that strategy and the similarities and differences in the manner in which it is accomplished by different viruses.

                            Origins of replication contain the sites at which viral DNA synthesis begins and can be defined experimentally as the minimal DNA segment necessary for initiation of replication in cells or in vitro reactions. Viral origins of replication support initiation of DNA synthesis by a variety of mechanisms, including some with no counterpart in cellular DNA synthesis. Nevertheless, they are discrete DNA segments that contain sequences recognized by viral origin recognition proteins to seed assembly of multiprotein complexes, and they exhibit a number of common features.</div>

                    <div class="sans w75">
                        A fundamental and important principle is that viruses replicate by the assembly of preformed components into particles. The parts are first made in cells and then assembled into the final product. The reproduction of viruses is very different from that of cells, which multiply by binary fission. This simple build-and-assemble strategy is unique to viruses, but the details for members of different virus families are astoundingly different. There are many ways to build a virus particle, and each one tells us something new about virus structure and assembly. <br>
                        <div class="indent">Modern studies of virus replication strategies have their origins in the work of Max Delbrück and colleagues, who studied the T-even bacteriophages starting in 1937. Delbrück believed that these bacteriophages were perfect models for understanding virus replication. He also thought that phages were excellent models for studying the gene: they were self-replicating (a hallmark of a gene); their mutations were inherited; and they were small, easily manipulated entities with short reproductive cycles. <br>
                        <div class="indent">Delbrück focused his attention on the fact that one bacterial cell usually makes hundreds of progeny virus particles. The yield from one cell is one viral generation; it was called the burst because viruses literally burst from the infected cell. </div></div></div>

                    <div class="sans">
                        Spontaneous and induced mutations In the early days of experimental virology, mutant viruses could be isolated only by screening stocks for interesting phenotypes, for none of the tools that we now take for granted, such as restriction endonucleases, efficient DNA sequencing methods, and molecular cloning procedures, were developed until the mid to late 1970s. RNA virus stocks usually contain a high proportion of mutants, and it is only a matter of devising the appropriate selection conditions (e.g., high or low temperature or exposure to drugs that inhibit viral reproduction) to select mutants with the desired phenotype from the total population. <br>
                        <div class="indent">
                            For example, the live attenuated poliovirus vaccine strains developed by Albert Sabin are mutants that were selected from a virulent virus stock. The low spontaneous mutation rate of DNA viruses necessitated random mutagenesis by exposure to a chemical mutagen. Mutagens such as nitrous acid, hydroxylamine, and alkylating agents chemically modify the nucleic acid in preparations of virus particles, resulting in changes in base pairing during subsequent genome replication. Mutagens such as base analogs, intercalating agents, or UV light are applied to the infected cell to cause changes in the viral genome during replication. Such agents introduce mutations more or less at random. <br>
                            <div class="indent">Some mutations are lethal under all conditions, while others have no effect and are said to be silent. To facilitate identification of mutants, the population must be screened for a phenotype that can be identified easily in a plaque assay. One such phenotype is temperature-sensitive viability of the virus. Virus mutants with this phenotype reproduce well at low temperatures, but poorly or not at all at high temperatures. The permissive and nonpermissive temperatures are typically 33 and 39°C, respectively, for viruses that replicate in mammalian cells. Other commonly sought phenotypes are changes in plaque size or morphology, drug resistance, antibody resistance, and host range (that is, loss of the ability to reproduce in certain hosts or host cells).

                   In the early 1900s, when viruses were first isolated, freezers and cell cultures were not available and it was necessary to maintain virus stocks by continuous passage from animal to animal. This practice not only was inconvenient but also, as we shall see in Volume II, Chapter 8, led to the selection of viral mutants. For example, monkey-to-monkey intracerebral passage of poliovirus selected a mutant that could no longer infect chimpanzees by the oral route, the natural means of infection. Cell culture has largely supplanted the use of animals for propagating viruses, but some viruses cannot yet be grown in this way. <br>
                   <div class="indent">Experimental infection of laboratory animals has always been, and will continue to be, obligatory for studying the processes by which viruses cause disease. The use of monkeys in the study of poliomyelitis, the paralytic disease caused by poliovirus, led to an understanding of the basis of this disease and was instrumental in the development of a successful vaccine. Similarly, the development of vaccines against hepatitis B virus would not have been possible without experimental studies with chimpanzees. Understanding how the immune system or any complex organ reacts to a virus cannot be achieved without research on living animals. The development of viral vaccines, antiviral drugs, and diagnostic tests for veterinary medicine has also abeneﬁted from research on diseases in laboratory animals.

                    Virus particles are designed for effective transmission of the nucleic acid genome from one host cell to another within a single organism or among host organisms. A primary function of the virion , an infectious virus particle, is protection of the genome, which can be damaged irreversibly by a break in the nucleic acid or by mutation during passage through hostile environments. During its travels, a virus particle may encounter a variety of potentially lethal chemical and physical agents, including proteolytic and nucleolytic enzymes, extremes of pH or temperature, and various forms of natural radiation. In all virus particles, the nucleic acid is sequestered within a sturdy barrier formed by extensive interactions among the viral proteins that comprise the protein coat. Such protein-protein interactions maintain surprisingly stable capsids: many virus particles composed of only protein and nucleic acid survive exposure to large variations in the temperature, pH, or chemical composition of their environment. For example, when dried onto a solid surface, human rotavirus (a major cause of gastroenteritis) loses < 20% of its infectivity in 30 days at room temperature, whereas the infectivity of poliovirus (a picornavirus) is reduced by some 5 orders of magnitude within 2 days. This same reduction in infectivity requires > 250 days when poliovirus particles suspended in spring water are incubated at room temperature at neutral pH.

            What, after all, is so special about genes? The answer is that they are replicators. The laws of physics are supposed to be true all over the accessible universe. Are there any principles of biology that are likely to have similar universal validity? When astronauts voyage to distant planets and look for life, they can expect to find creatures too strange and unearthly for us to imagine. But is there anything that must be true of all life, wherever it is found, and whatever the basis of its chemistry? If forms of life exist whose chemistry is based on silicon rather than carbon, or ammonia rather than water, if creatures are discovered that boil to death at −100 degrees centigrade, if a form of life is found that is not based on chemistry at all but on electronic reverberating circuits, will there still be any general principle that is true of all life? Obviously I do not know but, if I had to bet, I would put my money on one fundamental principle. This is the law that all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities.* The gene, the DNA molecule, happens to be the replicating entity that prevails on our own planet. There may be others. If there are, provided certain other conditions are met, they will almost inevitably tend to become the basis for an evolutionary process. <br>
            <div class="indent">But do we have to go to distant worlds to find other kinds of replicator and other, consequent, kinds of evolution? I think that a new kind of replicator has recently emerged on this very planet. It is staring us in the face. It is still in its infancy, still drifting clumsily about in its primeval soup, but already it is achieving evolutionary change at a rate that leaves the old gene panting far behind.</div>

            <div class="sans">
            The new soup is the soup of human culture. We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. ‘Mimeme’ comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like ‘gene’. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme.* If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to ‘memory’, or to the French word même. It should be pronounced to rhyme with ‘cream’. <br>
            <div class="indent">Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes, fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches. Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation. If a scientist hears, or reads about, a good idea, he passes it on to his colleagues and students. He mentions it in his articles and his lectures. If the idea catches on, it can be said to propagate itself, spreading from brain to brain. As my colleague N. K. Humphrey neatly summed up an earlier draft of this chapter: ‘… memes should be regarded as living structures, not just metaphorically but technically.* When you plant a fertile meme in my mind you literally parasitize my brain, turning it into a vehicle for the meme’s propagation in just the way that a virus may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell. And this isn’t just a way of talking—the meme for, say, “belief in life after death” is actually realized physically, millions of times over, as a structure in the nervous systems of individual men the world over.’</div>

            <div class="sans w75">
                Consider the idea of God. We do not know how it arose in the meme pool. Probably it originated many times by independent ‘mutation’. In any case, it is very old indeed. How does it replicate itself? By the spoken and written word, aided by great music andgreat art. Why does it have such high survival value? Rememberthat ‘survival value’ here does not mean value for a gene in a gene pool, but value for a meme in a meme pool. The question really means: What is it about the idea of a god that gives it its stability and penetrance in the cultural environment? The survival value of the god meme in the meme pool results from its great psychological appeal. It provides a superficially plausible answer to deepand troubling questions about existence. It suggests that injustices in this world may be rectified in the next. The ‘everlasting arms’ hold out a cushion against our own inadequacies which, like a doctor’s placebo, is none the less effective for being imaginary. These are some of the reasons why the idea of God is copiedso readily by successive generations of individual brains. God exists, if only in the form of a meme with high survival value, or infective power, in the environment provided by human culture. <br>
                <div class="indent"> Some of my colleagues have suggested to me that this account of the survival value of the god meme begs the question. In the last analysis they wish always to go back to ‘biological advantage’.To them it is not good enough to say that the idea of a god has ‘great psychological appeal’. They want to know why it has great psychological appeal. Psychological appeal means appeal to brains, and brains are shaped by natural selection of genes in gene pools. They want to find some way in which having a brain like that improves gene survival. <br><br><br>

            I have a lot of sympathy with this attitude, and I do not doubt that there are genetic advantages in our having brains of the kind that we have. But nevertheless I think that these colleagues, if they look carefully at the fundamentals of their own assumptions, will find that they are begging just as many questions as I am. Fundamentally, the reason why it is good policy for us to try to explain biological phenomena in terms of gene advantage is that genes are replicators. As soon as the primeval soup provided conditions in which molecules could make copies of themselves,the replicators themselves took over. For more than three thousand million years, DNA has been the only replicator worth talking about in the world. But it does not necessarily hold these monopoly rights for all time. Whenever conditions arise in which a new kind of replicator can make copies of itself, the new replicators will tend to take over, and start a new kind of evolution of their own. Once this new evolution begins, it will in no necessary sense be subservient to the old. The old gene-selected evolution, by making brains, provided the soup in which the first memes arose. Once self-copying memes had arisen, their own, much faster, kind of evolution took off. We biologists have assimilated the idea of genetic evolution so deeply that we tend to forget that it is only one of many possible kinds of evolution.

            Imitation, in the broad sense, is how memes can replicate. But just as not all genes that can replicate do so successfully, so some memes are more successful in the meme pool than others. This is the analogue of natural selection. I have mentioned particular examples of qualities that make for high survival value among memes. But in general they must be the same as those discussed for the replicators of Chapter 2: longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity.The longevity of any one copy of a meme is probably relatively unimportant, as it is for any one copy of a gene. The copy of the tune ‘Auld Lang Syne’ that exists in my brain will last only for the rest of my life.* The copy of the same tune that is printed in my volume of The Scottish Student’s Song Book is unlikely to last much longer. But I expect there will be copies of the same tune on paper and in peoples’ brains for centuries to come. As in the case of genes, fecundity is much more important than longevity of particular copies. If the meme is a scientific idea, its spread will depend on how acceptable it is to the population of individual scientists; a rough measure of its survival value could be obtained by counting the number of times it is referred to in successive years in scientific journals.* If it is a popular tune, its spread through the meme pool may be gauged by the number of people heard whistling it in the streets. If it is a style of women’s shoe, the population memeticist may use sales statistics from shoe shops. Some memes, like some genes, achieve brilliant short-term success in spreading rapidly, but do not last long in the meme pool. Popular songs and stiletto heels are examples. Others, such as the Jewish religious laws, may continue to propagate themselves for thousands of years, usually because of the great potential permanence of written records.

                This brings me to the third general quality of successful replicators: copying-fidelity. Here I must admit that I am on shaky ground. At first sight it looks as if memes are not high-fidelity replicators at all. Every time a scientist hears an idea and passes it on to somebody else, he is likely to change it somewhat. I have made no secret of my debt in this book to the ideas of R. L. Trivers. Yet I have not repeated them in his own words. I have twisted them round for my own purposes, changing the emphasis, blending them with ideas of my own and of other people. The memes are being passed on to you in altered form. This looks quite unlike the particulate, all-or-none quality of gene transmission. It looks as though meme transmission is subject to continuous mutation, and also to blending. <br>
                <div class="indent">It is possible that this appearance of non-particulateness is illusory, and that the analogy with genes does not break down. After all, if we look at the inheritance of many genetic characters such as human height or skin-colouring, it does not look like the work of indivisible and unblendable genes. If a black and a white person mate, their children do not come out either black or white: they are intermediate. This does not mean the genes concerned are not particulate. It is just that there are so many of them concerned with skin colour, each one having such a small effect, that they seem to blend.

                <div class="h2">Singularity</div>
            <div class="sans ">So far I have talked of memes as though it was obvious what a single unit-meme consisted of. But of course it is far from obvious. I have said a tune is one meme, but what about a symphony: how many memes is that? Is each movement one meme, each recognizable phrase of melody, each bar, each chord, or what? <br>
                <div class="indent">I appeal to the same verbal trick as I used in Chapter 3. There I divided the ‘gene complex’ into large and small genetic units, and units within units. The ‘gene’ was defined, not in a rigid all-ornone way, but as a unit of convenience, a length of chromosome with just sufficient copying-fidelity to serve as a viable unit of natural selection. If a single phrase of Beethoven’s ninth symphony is sufficiently distinctive and memorable to be abstracted from the context of the whole symphony, and used as the callsign of a maddeningly intrusive European broadcasting station, then to that extent it deserves to be called one meme. It has, incidentally, materially diminished my capacity to enjoy the original symphony.</div>

            Similarly, when we say that all biologists nowadays believe in Darwin’s theory, we do not mean that every biologist has, graven in his brain, an identical copy of the exact words of Charles Darwin himself. Each individual has his own way of interpreting Darwin’s ideas. He probably learned them not from Darwin’s own writings, but from more recent authors. Much of what Darwin said is, in detail, wrong. Darwin if he read this book would scarcely recognize his own original theory in it, though I hope he would like the way I put it. Yet, in spite of all this, there is something, some essence of Darwinism, which is present in the head of every individual who understands the theory. If this were not so, then almost any statement about two people agreeing with each other would be meaningless. An ‘idea-meme’ might be defined as an entity that is capable of being transmitted from one brain to another. The meme of Darwin’s theory is therefore that essential basis of the idea which is held in common by all brains that understand the theory. The differences in the ways that people represent the theory are then, by definition, not part of the meme. If Darwin’s theory can be subdivided into components, such that some people believe component A but not component B, while others believe B but not A, then A and B should be regarded as separate memes. If almost everybody who believes in A also believes in B—if the memes are closely ‘linked’ to use the genetic term—then it is convenient to lump them together as one meme.

            <div class="sans">
                Let us pursue the analogy between memes and genes further. Throughout this book, I have emphasized that we must not think of genes as conscious, purposeful agents. Blind natural selection, however, makes them behave rather as if they were purposeful, and it has been convenient, as a shorthand, to refer to genes in the language of purpose. For example, when we say ‘genes are trying to increase their numbers in future gene pools’, what we really mean is ‘those genes that behave in such a way as to increase their numbers in future gene pools tend to be the genes whose effects we see in the world’. Just as we have found it are radio and television time, billboard space, newspaper column-inches, and library shelf-space. <br><br><br> </div>

        <div class="editorial margintop150 overlay8">
            In the case of genes, we saw in Chapter 3 that co-adapted gene complexes may arise in the gene pool. A large set of genes concerned with mimicry in butterflies became tightly linked together on the same chromosome, so tightly that they can be treated as one gene. In Chapter 5 we met the more sophisticated idea of the evolutionarily stable set of genes. Mutually suitable teeth, claws, guts, and sense organs evolved in carnivore gene pools, while a different stable set of characteristics emerged from herbivore gene pools. Does anything analogous occur in meme pools? Has the god meme, say, become associated with any other particular memes, and does this association assist the survival of each of the participating memes? Perhaps we could regard an organized church, with its architecture, rituals, laws, music, art, and written tradition, as a co-adapted stable set of mutually-assisting memes. <br> <div class="indent">To take a particular example, an aspect of doctrine that has been very effective in enforcing religious observance is the threat of hell fire. Many children and even some adults believe that they will suffer ghastly torments after death if they do not obey the priestly rules. This is a peculiarly nasty technique of persuasion, causing great psychological anguish throughout the Middle Ages and even today. But it is highly effective. It might almost have been planned deliberately by a Machiavellian priesthood trained in deep psychological indoctrination techniques. However, I doubt if the priests were that clever. Much more probably, unconscious memes have ensured their own survival by virtue of those same qualities of pseudo-ruthlessness that successful genes display. The idea of hell fire is, quite simply, self perpetuating, because of its own deep psychological impact. It has become linked with the god meme because the two reinforce each other, and assist each other’s survival in the meme pool. <br>
            <div class="indent"> Another member of the religious meme complex is called faith. It means blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence. The story of Doubting Thomas is told, not so that we shall admire Thomas, but so that we can admire the other apostles in comparison. Thomas demanded evidence. Nothing is more lethal for certain kinds of meme than a tendency to look for evidence. The other apostles, whose faith was so strong that they did not need evidence, are held up to us as worthy of imitation. The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry. <br>
            <div class="indent">Blind faith can justify anything.* If a man believes in a different god, or even if he uses a different ritual for worshipping the same god, blind faith can decree that he should die—on the cross, at the stake, skewered on a Crusader’s sword, shot in a Beirut street, or blown up in a bar in Belfast. Memes for blind faith have their own ruthless ways of propagating themselves. This is true of patriotic and political as well as religious blind faith. <br>
            <div class="indent">Memes and genes may often reinforce each other, but they sometimes come into opposition. For example, the habit of celibacy is presumably not inherited genetically. A gene for celibacy is doomed to failure in the gene pool, except under very special circumstances such as we find in the social insects. But still, a meme for celibacy can be successful in the meme pool. For example, suppose the success of a meme depends critically on how much time people spend in actively transmitting it to other people. Any time spent in doing other things than attempting to transmit the meme may be regarded as time wasted from the meme’s point of view. The meme for celibacy is transmitted by priests to young boys who have not yet decided what they want to do with their lives. The medium of transmission is human influence of various kinds, the spoken and written word, personal example, and so on. Suppose, for the sake of argument, it happened to be the case that marriage weakened the power of a priest to influence his flock, say because it occupied a large proportion of his time and attention. This has, indeed, been advanced as an official reason for the enforcement of celibacy among priests. If this were the case, it would follow that the meme for celibacy could have greater survival value than the meme for marriage. Of course, exactly the opposite would be true for a gene for celibacy. If a priest is a survival machine for memes, celibacy is a useful attribute to build into him. Celibacy is just a minor partner in a large complex of mutually-assisting religious memes. <br>
            <div class="indent">I conjecture that co-adapted meme-complexes evolve in the same kind of way as co-adapted gene-complexes. Selection favours memes that exploit their cultural environment to their own advantage. This cultural environment consists of other memes which are also being selected. The meme pool therefore comes to have the attributes of an evolutionarily stable set, which new memes find it hard to invade.

                Consider the idea of God. We do not know how it arose in thememe pool. Probably it originated many times by independent‘mutation’. In any case, it is very old indeed. How does it replicateitself? By the spoken and written word, aided by great music andgreat art. Why does it have such high survival value? Rememberthat ‘survival value’ here does not mean value for a gene in a genepool, but value for a meme in a meme pool. The question reallymeans: What is it about the idea of a god that gives it its stabilityand penetrance in the cultural environment? The survival valueof the god meme in the meme pool results from its great psychologicalappeal. It provides a superficially plausible answer to deepand troubling questions about existence. It suggests that injusticesin this world may be rectified in the next. The ‘everlastingarms’ hold out a cushion against our own inadequacies which,like a doctor’s placebo, is none the less effective for being imaginary.These are some of the reasons why the idea of God is copiedso readily by successive generations of individual brains. Godexists, if only in the form of a meme with high survival value, orinfective power, in the environment provided by human culture.Some of my colleagues have suggested to me that this accountof the survival value of the god meme begs the question. In thelast analysis they wish always to go back to ‘biological advantage’.To them it is not good enough to say that the idea of a godhas ‘great psychological appeal’. They want to know why it hasgreat psychological appeal. Psychological appeal means appealto brains, and brains are shaped by natural selection of genes in gene pools. They want to find some way in which having a brainlike that improves gene survival.
                <br>
                I have a lot of sympathy with this attitude, and I do not doubtthat there are genetic advantages in our having brains of thekind that we have. But nevertheless I think that these colleagues,if they look carefully at the fundamentals of their own assumptions,will find that they are begging just as many questions asI am. Fundamentally, the reason why it is good policy for us totry to explain biological phenomena in terms of gene advantageis that genes are replicators. As soon as the primeval soup providedconditions in which molecules could make copies of themselves,the replicators themselves took over. For more than threethousand million years, DNA has been the only replicator worthtalking about in the world. But it does not necessarily hold thesemonopoly rights for all time. Whenever conditions arise in whicha new kind of replicator can make copies of itself, the new replicatorswill tend to take over, and start a new kind of evolution oftheir own. Once this new evolution begins, it will in no necessarysense be subservient to the old. The old gene-selected evolution,by making brains, provided the soup in which the first memesarose. Once self-copying memes had arisen, their own, muchfaster, kind of evolution took off. We biologists have assimilatedthe idea of genetic evolution so deeply that we tend to forget thatit is only one of many possible kinds of evolution.
